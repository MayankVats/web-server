-  __dirname gives path to the directory that the current file is in.

- With template engines we can make reusable markups instead of repeating the code.

- handlebar (hbs) is a template engine which expects all of our views to be in a folder named "view"

- To serve the static content put the resources in "public" directory.

- res.render() is used to render our views

- By default nodemon listens to changes only in the js files, to include other files use the -e flag with file extensions (ex: nodemon app.js -e js,hbs)
